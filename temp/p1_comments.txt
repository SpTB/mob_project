"1" ":\"My decisions were mainly based on the first few days of the process. I thought that if I was getting a lot of net gain then I should continue with the risky option for more overall profit.\",\"Strat\":\"Not at the beginning. As time went on I would almost always play risky for the first 10 days, see where my net gain/loss is at, and then evaluate from there. If I was at least halfway to the goal, I would continue for sure. If I didn't get much gain by day ~15, I would payout.\",\"Prefer\":\"I preferred the risky option, for sure. I enjoyed trying to find any patterns in the point accumulation and strategizing to figure out what my best move was for profit.\",\"Other\":\"}"
"2" ":\"I was considering the progress along the bar I should be on any given day (e.g. on day 10 I should be halfway along the bar).\",\"Strat\":\"If by day 5 I was still nearly-red, I should skip.  If on day 10 I was halfway along the bar, I should probably continue to try the risky strategy.\",\"Prefer\":\"I wanted to aim for the risky project until it did not appear feasible with the expected values of the randomised value.\",\"Other\":\"I did accidentally press 'z' on day 1 on one of the days as I was using the same hand for spacebar (on thumb) as Z, and I moved my entire hand, hit spacebar to enter the round, and then immediately Z to leave it.  This was an error - I did not mean to just take the risk free option.\"}"
"3" ":\"I would rapidly press the risk option unless I saw that the safe option was at it's highest which I believe was 4 cents. \",\"Strat\":\"Same as my though process. \",\"Prefer\":\"I preferred the risk option because it was more exciting, kind of like gambling. You didn't know what you were going to get like the safe option. \",\"Other\":\"n/a\"}"
"4" ":\"I figured that it was always going to be a bigger payout if I went to the end and it hit the goal.\",\"Strat\":\"Just keep pressing p until I got the goal. Sometimes, I figured it wasn't going to make it so I would cashout at a super low amount.\",\"Prefer\":\"I liked staying with bigger risk because I wanted the payout.\",\"Other\":\"Definitely very interesting but got tiresome at the end.\"}"
"5" ":\"I considered the past maximum amount of goal points available against how many chances I had left starting around 10 days each time.\",\"Strat\":\"Test as close as I could, but if I knew I'd fail I would go for the safe option.\",\"Prefer\":\"Cyan!!!\",\"Other\":\"}"
