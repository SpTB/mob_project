system 1/2

unconvinced - the premise seems arbitrary and unsubstantiated. 
-why we need a separate explicit system? just to read out - it seems the only reason is to communicate? And why should it influence behavior?

social vs non-social is fine, but I don't see how or why should it map to  explicit vs implicit

i'm fine with the distinction between explicit and implicit, as well as social vs non-social metacog, but I see no reason ...

I can have explicit metacog of my confidence which I don't communicate with anyone... I can have implicit metacognition about emotional experiences of others...
