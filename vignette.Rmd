This repo contains easily accesible simulation code for calculating optimal thresholds in the MOB task. The code is written on a pipeline-driven library `targets`. All the top-level code is contained in the '_targets.R' file. One can adjust the simulation parameters by changing the parameters in the first target (see `_targets.R` file for details). Then, to run the pipeline:

```{r}
require(targets)
tar_make()
```

To check the output, load or read the target elements. *E.g.*
```{r}
tar_load(sims)
```
will load the simulated threshold data frame, and
```{r}
tar_read(opt_plot)
```
will directly plot the thresholds.

You can also visualize all the elements of the pipeline:
```{r}
tar_visnetwork()
```
